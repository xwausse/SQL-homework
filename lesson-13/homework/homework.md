Homework Puzzles

Puzzle 1

Count the spaces present in the string using multiple approaches.

Sample Input:


CREATE TABLE CountSpaces ( texts VARCHAR(100) );
INSERT INTO CountSpaces(texts) VALUES
('P Q R S '),
(' L M N O 0 0     '),
('I  am here only '),
(' Welcome to the new world '),
(' Hello world program'),
(' Are u nuts ');

Expected Output:

Count of spaces for each row.



Puzzle 2

Count different types of characters from a string.

Sample Input:


DECLARE @ AS VARCHAR(1000) = 'AddsfsdfWUES 12*&';

Expected Output:

Uppercase letter count

Lowercase letter count

Other character count



Puzzle 3

Generate a date sequence using a CTE.

Define limits:


DECLARE @todate datetime, @fromdate datetime;
SET @fromdate = '2009-01-01';
SET @todate = '2009-12-31';

Expected Output:

Generate a sequential date list with various extracted date parts.



Puzzle 4

Split a column into two columns using different approaches.

Sample Input:


CREATE TABLE TestMultipleColumns ( Id INT NULL, Name VARCHAR(20) NULL );
INSERT INTO TestMultipleColumns VALUES
(1, 'Pawan,Kumar'),
(2, 'Sandeep,Goyal'),
(3, 'Isha,Mattoo'),
(4, 'Gopal,Ranjan'),
(5, 'Neeraj,Garg'),
(6, 'Deepak,Sharma'),
(7, 'Mayank,Tripathi');

Expected Output:

Name column split into Name and Surname using at least three different approaches.
