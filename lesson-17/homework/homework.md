Notes Before Doing the Tasks
✅ All tasks must be solved using SQL Server.
🔠 Case sensitivity (uppercase or lowercase) does not affect scoring.
✏️ Use of alias names is allowed and does not affect the result.
🧠 Only the correctness of the result matters — any correct solution is accepted.

You're working in a database for a Retail Sales System. The database contains the following tables:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(100),
    Category VARCHAR(50),
    Price DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE Sales (
    SaleID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductID INT,
    Quantity INT,
    SaleDate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID)
);

INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName, Category, Price)
VALUES

INSERT INTO Sales (SaleID, ProductID, Quantity, SaleDate)
VALUES
(1, 1, 2, '2025-04-01'),
(2, 1, 1, '2025-04-05'),

```
### 1. Create a temporary table named MonthlySales to store the total quantity sold and total revenue for each product in the current month.
**Return: ProductID, TotalQuantity, TotalRevenue**

### 2. Create a view named vw_ProductSalesSummary that returns product info along with total sales quantity across all time.
**Return: ProductID, ProductName, Category, TotalQuantitySold**

### 3. Create a function named fn_GetTotalRevenueForProduct(@ProductID INT)
**Return: total revenue for the given product ID**

### 4. Create an function fn_GetSalesByCategory(@Category VARCHAR(50))
**Return: ProductName, TotalQuantity, TotalRevenue for all products in that category.**

# Now we will move on with 2 Lateral-thinking puzzles (5 and 6th puzzles). Lateral-thinking puzzles are the ones that can’t be solved by straightforward logic — you have to think outside the box. 🔍🧠

### 5. You have to create a function that get one argument as input from user and the function should return 'Yes' if the input number is a prime number and 'No' otherwise. You can start it like this:
```sql
Create function dbo.fn_IsPrime (@Number INT)
Returns ...
```

```
This is for those who has no idea about prime numbers: A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has only two divisors: 1 and itself(2, 3, 5, 7 and so on).
```

### 6. Create a table-valued function named fn_GetNumbersBetween that accepts two integers as input:
```sql
@Start INT
@End INT
```
**The function should return a table with a single column:**
```sql
| Number |
|--------|
| @Start |
...
...
...
|   @end |
```

**It should include all integer values from @Start to @End, inclusive.**

### 7. Write a SQL query to return the Nth highest distinct salary from the Employee table. If there are fewer than N distinct salaries, return NULL. 

**NOTE: You have to do some research on Dense_rank window function.**

### Example 1:

**Input.Employee table:**

```
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
```

### n = 2

**Output:**
```sql
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
```
```sql
|    HighestNSalary      |
|------------------------|
| 200                    |
```

### Example 2:

**Input.Employee table:**

```sql
| id | salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |
```


### n = 2
**Output:**
```sql
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
```
```sql
|    HighestNSalary      |
|        null            |
```

### 8. Write a SQL query to find the person who has the most friends.

**Return: Their id, The total number of friends they have**

#### Friendship is mutual. For example, if user A sends a request to user B and it's accepted, both A and B are considered friends with each other. The test case is guaranteed to have only one user with the most friends.

**Input.RequestAccepted table:**

```
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1            | 2           | 2016/06/03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016/06/09  |
```

**Output:** 
```
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 3  | 3   |
```

**Explanation: The person with id 3 is a friend of people 1, 2, and 4, so he has three friends in total, which is the most number than any others.**

**You can also solve this in Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-requests-ii-who-has-the-most-friends/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50**

### 9. Create a View for Customer Order Summary. 
```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Customers(customer_id),
    order_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- Customers
INSERT INTO Customers (customer_id, name, city)
VALUES
(1, 'Alice Smith', 'New York'),
(2, 'Bob Jones', 'Chicago'),
(3, 'Carol White', 'Los Angeles');

-- Orders
INSERT INTO Orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date, amount)
VALUES
(101, 1, '2024-12-10', 120.00),
(102, 1, '2024-12-20', 200.00),
(103, 1, '2024-12-30', 220.00),
(104, 2, '2025-01-12', 120.00),
(105, 2, '2025-01-20', 180.00);
```
**Create a view called vw_CustomerOrderSummary that returns a summary of customer orders. The view must contain the following columns:**

> - Column Name | Description
> - customer_id | Unique identifier of the customer
> - name | Full name of the customer
> - total_orders | Total number of orders placed by the customer
> - total_amount | Cumulative amount spent across all orders
> - last_order_date | Date of the most recent order placed by the customer

### 10. Write an SQL statement to fill in the missing gaps. You have to write only select statement, no need to modify the table.

```
|Row Number	|	Workflow	|	Status	|
|---------------------------------------|
|	  1		|	  Alpha		|	 Pass	|
|	  2		|				|	 Fail	|
|	  3		|				|	 Fail	|
|	  4		|				|	 Fail	|
|	  5		|	  Bravo		|	 Pass	|
|	  6		|				|	 Fail	|
|	  7		|				|	 Fail	|
|	  8		|				|	 Pass	|
|	  9		|				|	 Pass	|
|	  10	|	 Charlie	|	 Fail	|
|	  11	|				|	 Fail	|
|	  12	|				|	 Fail	|
-----------------------------------------
```

**Here is the expected output.**
```
|Row Number	|	Workflow	|	Status	|
|---------------------------------------|
|	  1		|	  Alpha		|	 Pass	|
|	  2		|	  Alpha		|	 Fail	|
|	  3		|	  Alpha		|	 Fail	|
|	  4		|	  Alpha		|	 Fail	|
|	  5		|	  Bravo		|	 Pass	|
|	  6		|	  Bravo		|	 Fail	|
|	  7		|	  Bravo		|	 Fail	|
|	  8		|	  Bravo		|	 Pass	|
|	  9		|	  Bravo		|	 Pass	|
|	  10	|	 Charlie	|	 Fail	|
|	  11	|	 Charlie	|	 Fail	|
|	  12	|	 Charlie	|	 Fail	|
```

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Gaps;

CREATE TABLE Gaps
(
RowNumber   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
TestCase    VARCHAR(100) NULL
);

INSERT INTO Gaps (RowNumber, TestCase) VALUES
(1,'Alpha'),(2,NULL),(3,NULL),(4,NULL),
(5,'Bravo'),(6,NULL),(7,'Charlie'),(8,NULL),(9,NULL);
```
